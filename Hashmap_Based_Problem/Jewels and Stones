#Problem Statement
You’re given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so “a” is considered a different type of stone from “A”.

import java.util.*;

public class Main
{
    public static void JewelsAndStones(String Jewels,String Stones){
        //HashSet is a class in Collection Framework. It use hash table for storage.
        //HashSet store unique data elements.
        
        HashSet<Character> jewelSet = new HashSet<>();
        int count=0;
        
        //Inserting the jewels in HashSet 
        for(int i=0;i<Jewels.length();i++){
            jewelSet.add(Jewels.charAt(i));
        }
        
        //checking whether stone character is present inside the HashSet 
        // if Stone character is present inside JewelSet, than the stone is jewel => count++;
        for(int i=0;i<Stones.length();i++){
            if(jewelSet.contains(Stones.charAt(i))){
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(count);
    }
    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    String J = "aA"; 
	    String S = "aaAbbabb";
	    
	    JewelsAndStones(J,S);
	}
}
